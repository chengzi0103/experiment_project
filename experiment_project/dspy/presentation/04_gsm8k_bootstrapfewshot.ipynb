Calculate the total distance for one round trip: - Distance up: \\\\( \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\times 40,000 = 30,000 \\\\) feet. - Distance down: \\\\( \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\times 40,000 = 30,000 \\\\) feet. - Total distance for one round trip: \\\\( 30,000 + 30,000 = 60,000 \\\\) feet. 3. Calculate the total distance for 10 round trips: - Total distance for 10 round trips: \\\\( 10 \\\\times 60,000 = 600,000 \\\\) feet.\\nAnswer: 600,000 feet\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to determine the number of shooting stars each person counted and then find the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them. Finally, we will compare the number of shooting stars Sam counted to this average. 1. Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. 2. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted \\\\( 14 - 2 = 12 \\\\) shooting stars. 3. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted \\\\( 12 + 4 = 16 \\\\) shooting stars. Next, we calculate the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them: \\\\[ \\\\text{Average} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total number of shooting stars}}{\\\\text{Number of people}} = \\\\frac{14 + 12 + 16}{3} = \\\\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\\\] Finally, we find how many more shooting stars Sam counted compared to the average: \\\\[ \\\\text{Difference} = 16 - 14 = 2 \\\\]\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah buys over the three days. 1. On Monday, Sarah buys 20 pencils. 2. On Tuesday, she buys 18 more pencils. 3. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Now, we add up all the pencils she bought: - Monday: 20 pencils - Tuesday: 18 pencils - Wednesday: 54 pencils Total number of pencils = 20 + 18 + 54 = 92 pencils.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Burt spent $2.00 on a packet of basil seeds and $8.00 on potting soil.

What is the net profit from his basil plants?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\x1b[32m produce the answer. We need to calculate the total revenue Burt earns from selling the basil plants and then subtract his total expenses to find the net profit.\\n\\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the basil plants:\\n   - Burt sells each basil plant for $5.00.\\n   - He has 20 basil plants.\\n   - Total revenue = 20 plants * $5.00/plant = $100.00.\\n\\n2. Calculate the total expenses:\\n   - Cost of basil seeds = $2.00.\\n   - Cost of potting soil = $8.00.\\n   - Total expenses = $2.00 + $8.00 = $10.00.\\n\\n3. Calculate the net profit:\\n   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total expenses = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.\\n\\nAnswer: $90.00\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n\""

We need to determine the number of shooting stars each person counted and then find the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them. Finally, we will compare the number of shooting stars Sam counted to this average. 1. Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. 2. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted \\\\( 14 - 2 = 12 \\\\) shooting stars. 3. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted \\\\( 12 + 4 = 16 \\\\) shooting stars. Next, we calculate the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them: \\\\[ \\\\text{Average} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total number of shooting stars}}{\\\\text{Number of people}} = \\\\frac{14 + 12 + 16}{3} = \\\\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\\\] Finally, we find how many more shooting stars Sam counted compared to the average: \\\\[ \\\\text{Difference} = 16 - 14 = 2 \\\\]\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah buys over the three days. 1. On Monday, Sarah buys 20 pencils. 2. On Tuesday, she buys 18 more pencils. 3. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Now, we add up all the pencils she bought: - Monday: 20 pencils - Tuesday: 18 pencils - Wednesday: 54 pencils Total number of pencils = 20 + 18 + 54 = 92 pencils.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: 35+ 29 *23 -89218 是多少?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\",\n",

Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine Marion\\'s score. We start by calculating Ella\\'s score. Since the exam has 40 items and Ella got 4 incorrect answers, Ella\\'s score is: \\\\\\\\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \\\\\\\\] Next, we need to find Marion\\'s score. According to the problem, Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. First, we calculate half of Ella\\'s score: \\\\\\\\[ \\\\\\\\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\\\\\\\] Then, we add 6 to this value to find Marion\\'s score: \\\\\\\\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \\\\\\\\]\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain\\'s height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered.\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to calculate the total distance Stephen covered during his trips. 1. First, determine the distance covered in one trip up and down the mountain: - Each trip up the mountain reaches 3/4 of the mountain\\'s height. - Therefore, the distance covered in one trip up is \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\\\\\times 40,000 \\\\\\\\) feet. - The distance covered in one trip down is the same, \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\\\\\times 40,000 \\\\\\\\) feet. 2. Calculate the total distance for one round trip: - Distance up: \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\\\\\times 40,000 = 30,000 \\\\\\\\) feet. - Distance down: \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\\\\\times 40,000 = 30,000 \\\\\\\\) feet. - Total distance for one round trip: \\\\\\\\( 30,000 + 30,000 = 60,000 \\\\\\\\) feet. 3. Calculate the total distance for 10 round trips: - Total distance for 10 round trips: \\\\\\\\( 10 \\\\\\\\times 60,000 = 600,000 \\\\\\\\) feet.\\\\nAnswer: 600,000 feet\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.
