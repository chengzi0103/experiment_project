We need to set up a system of equations to solve this problem. Let's denote the number of chickens (雉) as \\\\( C \\\\) and the number of rabbits (兔子) as \\\\( R \\\\).\\n\\n1. From the problem, we know that the total number of heads is 35. Since each animal has one head, we can write the first equation as:\\n\\\\[ C + R = 35 \\\\]\\n\\n2. We also know that the total number of feet is 94. Chickens have 2 feet each, and rabbits have 4 feet each. This gives us the second equation:\\n\\\\[ 2C + 4R = 94 \\\\]\\n\\n3. To solve this system of equations, we can first simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\\n\\\\[ C + 2R = 47 \\\\]\\n\\n4. Now we have the following system of linear equations:\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{cases} \\nC + R = 35 \\\\\\\\\\nC + 2R = 47 \\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\]\\n\\n5. We can solve for \\\\( C \\\\) by subtracting the first equation from the second:\\n\\\\[ (C + 2R) - (C + R) = 47 - 35 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ C + 2R - C - R = 12 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ R = 12 \\\\]\\n\\n6. Now that we know \\\\( R = 12 \\\\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\\\( C \\\\):\\n\\\\[ C + 12 = 35 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ C = 35 - 12 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ C = 23 \\\\]\\n\\nAnswer: There are 23 chickens and 12 rabbits.\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the fields `question`, produce the fields `answer`.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFollow the following format.\\n\\nQuestion: ${question}\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to ${produce the answer}.
