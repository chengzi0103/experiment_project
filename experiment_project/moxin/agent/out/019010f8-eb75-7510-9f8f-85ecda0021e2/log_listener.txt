RuntimeError: failed to init event stream

Caused by:
    subscribe failed: Some nodes exited before subscribing to dora: {NodeId("agents"), NodeId("loader")}

    This is typically happens when an initialization error occurs
                    in the node or operator. To check the output of the failed
                    nodes, run `dora logs 019010f8-eb75-7510-9f8f-85ecda0021e2 <node_id>`.
