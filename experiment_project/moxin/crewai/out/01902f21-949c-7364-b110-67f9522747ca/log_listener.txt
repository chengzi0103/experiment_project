Crewai Agent Result: This article, potentially authored by Zhentao Xu among others, was published on 6 May 2024. The primary objective of the article is to present a novel approach for parsing issue tickets into trees and interconnecting them to form a graph. This method aims to improve retrieval performance and address the limitations associated with conventional methods. These limitations include loss of vital information due to text compression and reduced answer quality due to segmentation. The proposed method maintains the intrinsic relationship among entities, thereby preserving the logical coherence of ticket sections.

Crewai Agent Result: The article 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs for Customer Service Question Answering' was authored by Zhentao Xu and presented at the SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024. The main goal of the article is the development of a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a Knowledge Graph. This method constructs a Knowledge Graph from historical issues for use in retrieval, keeping the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations intact. During the question-answering phase, the system parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the Knowledge Graph to generate answers. This integration of a Knowledge Graph improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. The method has been deployed within LinkedIn’s customer service team and has shown significant performance improvement.
