Final Answer: 
After conducting a comprehensive analysis, here are the key findings for NVIDIA and Tesla's stocks from the beginning of 2022 till now:

NVIDIA:
- NVIDIA has demonstrated a strong market performance with significant growth in its stock prices. This is primarily due to the increasing demand for its GPUs in both gaming and professional markets.
- The financial performance of NVIDIA is robust, with high revenues and profits. The company's investment in AI and deep learning technologies seems to be paying off.
- Potential risks include intense competition in the semiconductor industry and potential regulatory hurdles. NVIDIA's planned acquisition of Arm Ltd. is facing scrutiny from various regulatory bodies.

Tesla:
- Tesla's stock performance has been volatile. While there was a significant drop in stock prices earlier in the year, it has since rebounded.
- Tesla's financial performance has improved, with the company reporting profits for several consecutive quarters. The company's focus on improving production and delivery numbers has contributed to its improved financial performance.
- Potential risks include the reliance on the charismatic but unpredictable CEO, Elon Musk, and the intense competition in the electric vehicle market. Regulatory risks also exist, particularly with regard to autonomous driving technology.

Comparative Analysis:
- When comparing NVIDIA and Tesla, it's evident that both companies have different risk profiles. NVIDIA seems to have a more stable performance, driven by the high demand for its products in multiple sectors. Tesla, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the vision of its CEO and is more vulnerable to market sentiment.
- In terms of financial performance, both companies have shown strong results, but NVIDIA's more diversified product portfolio might make it a less risky investment.

In conclusion, both NVIDIA and Tesla have their strengths and potential risks. An investor should take these factors into consideration when deciding to invest in these stocks.[0m

I have gathered the search results related to Tesla. I need to analyze these results to understand Tesla's potential growth in the upcoming quarters. The results show that Tesla's stock performance has been volatile, but it has since rebounded. Future growth might be impacted by several factors including the company's ability to increase production and deliver on its promises, potential regulatory issues, as well as the overall health of the electric vehicle market. 

Now, I will summarize my findings for both NVIDIA and Tesla.

Thought: 
I now know the final answer.

Final Answer: 
NVIDIA has shown significant growth due to the increasing demand for its GPUs in gaming and professional markets. This trend is expected to continue, driving further growth in the upcoming quarters. However, potential risks include supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing global chip shortage.

Tesla, on the other hand, has experienced volatility in its stock prices, but has shown resilience with a rebound. The company's future growth might be influenced by its ability to increase production and deliver on its promises, potential regulatory issues, and the overall health of the electric vehicle market. Therefore, while both companies have strong growth potential, they also come with their own set of risks that need to be carefully considered.[0m
