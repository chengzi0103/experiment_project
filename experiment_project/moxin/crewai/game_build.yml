      You will create a game using Python, these are the instructions:

      Instructions
      ------------
      - Create a screen where the snake can move.
      - Implement snake movement controlled by arrow keys.
      - Generate food items at random locations on the screen.
      - Ensure the snake grows longer when it eats food.
      - Implement collision detection to end the game if the snake hits the wall or itself.
      - Display the current score.

      Your final answer must be the full Python code, only the Python code and nothing else.

      ------------
      - Create a screen where the snake can move.
      - Implement snake movement controlled by arrow keys.
      - Generate food items at random locations on the screen.
      - Ensure the snake grows longer when it eats food.
      - Implement collision detection to end the game if the snake hits the wall or itself.
      - Display the current score.

      Using the code you got, check for errors. Check for logic errors, syntax errors, missing imports, variable declarations, mismatched brackets, and security vulnerabilities.
