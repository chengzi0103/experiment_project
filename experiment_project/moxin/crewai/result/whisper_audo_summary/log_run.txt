 Apple Intelligence in five minutes. It's personal intelligence right where you need it, on your Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Writing tools are an example of the incredible power of Apple Intelligence. Say you're writing an email. You can change the tone to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise. Another way writing tools can help you is with proofread. With proofread, you can nail the grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. If you've rambled on in your email, bring out the key points and add them as a TLDR. Apple Intelligence is also great when it comes to images. Let's jump in with Genmoji. You want a T-Rex on a surfboard? You've got a T-Rex on a surfboard. Simply type a description of the emoji you want. How about a smiley face with cucumber eyes or something random like a squirrel DJ? Because Apple Intelligence knows who's in your photo library, you can turn your friend V into an astronaut. Next up, image playground. Create awesome images in seconds, like an image of a cat as a chef. Just type rooftop and any other descriptive words, and it generates the image in the middle playground area. Then choose a style like animation, sketch, or illustration, and it's done. Apple Intelligence also understands who people are in your photo library, so you can create a personalized image of them for their birthday, or your mom is a superhero. Image One can transform your rough sketch into a polished image. You can use Apple Pencil to circle it, and Image One analyzes your sketch in words and creates an image for you like magic. Siri takes a huge step forward and is now supercharged by Apple Intelligence. When you talk to Siri, you'll notice this elegant glowing light around the edge of your screen that shows Apple Intelligence working for you. With natural language, you can speak to Siri more naturally thanks to richer language understanding capabilities. If you stumble over words, Siri still understands what you're getting at. What's the weather tomorrow morning at Muir Beach? I mean Muir Woods. The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning near Muir Woods National Monument. Siri also remembers what you've just been talking about. Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9 AM. Hike is scheduled for 9 AM to 11 AM on June 11th. Next, personal context draws from your photos, calendar events, messages, and other apps. So let's say your mom is coming to visit. Simply ask, Siri, when is mom's flight landing? Siri already knows who mom is and will cross-reference flight details from an email to give you an up-to-date arrival time. If you've forgotten what plans you have, you can say, what's our dinner plan? Siri knows you mean you and your mom and will find that information in a text she sent you. If you don't want to ask Siri out loud, you can now type to Siri. Just a double tap at the bottom of the screen and you can quickly and quietly type your Siri request. Because Apple Intelligence is personal, priority notifications show what's important to you by putting the most important ones at the top of the stack. Personal Intelligence can also make you the star in your very own memory movie. It understands who's in your photo library, so you can just ask photos to create a movie about Leo learning to fish. And it'll whip up a film starring Leo, water, fishing rods, and depending on how successful Leo was, a fish. So those are just a few of the ways Apple Intelligence can help you every day. It's super easy to use and gives you peace of mind knowing it's designed with privacy from the ground up. So that's Apple Intelligence, AI for the rest of us.

真是太棒了我沒想到AI會這麼好我做了一些現場的示範當中有些東西失敗了AI會重新輸入失敗的部分我其實有很多時候會覺得哇 我的AI系統我真的不能相信我的AI系統只是這樣自行調整但我從GPT上用了一個例子來自我學習的請你給女生在讀書時發出一張圖片然後把圖片跟男生一樣例如jpeg請你寫下女生在讀的圖片所以像這樣今天AI人士可以決定首先要決定男生的姿勢然後找出對的模式可能是抱抱的然後要把姿勢取出然後下一個要找出對的模式來把女生的圖片作為指示來做進行然後用來寫圖片然後最後用來寫言語今天我們有些AI人士我不會說他們很實際他們很隨意他們不常用但當他們用的時候其實還蠻有趣的但用AI人士來做有時候可以重新復發從前的失敗我自己已經找到有些人用資料人員在我工作上我只是一份資料人員但我沒有感覺到自己在搜尋花了很長時間我只會把資料人員送到資料人員在幾分鐘內再看看有什麼可以做有時候可以有時候不可以但這已經是我的個人工作最後的設計模式是多人人合作這是一個有趣的東西但它比你可能想像的更好但它比你可能想像的更好但左邊是一張圖片叫做Chatdev是完全開放的是開放的很多人都看到Demo的社交媒體的Demonstration的DemonstrationChatdev是開放的它在我的電腦上開放Chatdev是一個多人人合作的系統你會提供一種LM在某個時候像是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人而這堆的經理人你建立的你會提供LM告訴他們你現在是一個軟體工程機的經理人你現在是一個軟體工程機的經理人他們會合作有一個廣泛的交流如果你們告訴他們請發展一個遊戲發展一個GoMoki遊戲他們會在幾分鐘內寫文章測試編輯然後發展像是非常複雜的程式不一定會成功我用過了有時候不成功有時候很厲害但這技術真的在變得更好而一個設計的模式就像是多個經理人的討論有不同的經理人例如有ChaiGPD還有Gemini討論著這其實也會有更好的表現所以有很多類似的經理人一起合作也有很強大的設計模式所以說起來總結來說這些是我們所見的模式如果我們用這些模式我們很多人都能夠得到很快的實力我認為Agentic的設計模式是非常重要的這是我的小圖我預計Agentic的設計模式在今年會大幅地增長因為Agentic的工作有些人很難熟悉的事就是我們在LM上發表訊息我們會馬上回應在一年多前我去Google發表訊息我們叫做大搜尋我們會發出長期訊息我失敗的原因是因為當你發表搜尋你會回應不到一半這是人類的方式我們喜歡那種即時的訊息但在很多Agentic的工作我認為我們需要學習如何提供Agentic的訊息讓人們用心地等待可能甚至等待一小時讓人們回應但我看到很多新手提供一些訊息給別人然後再檢查五分鐘後這並不成功我認為這會很困難我們需要與Agentic的一些人一起做這件事我失敗了另外,另一個重要的步驟是快速的訊息在Agentic的工作我們在每個部分都在編繩所以LM會在讀取訊息的速度上編繩所以能夠在讀取訊息的速度上編繩比任何人都要快這很棒我認為編繩的速度會很快即使LM的質量是低也會有好的成果相比起更慢的LM可能會有一點點困難因為可能會讓你在這段路上很多多次走我認為我所展示的結果是GPD3和Agent的建築在第一張圖表上而Candidly我真的期待Clar 4、GPD5、Gemini 2.0以及其他一般的一般的模式在Mimpio建築而我認為如果你想要在GPD5上發展你可能會比較接近那種程度的表現或是一些應用程式你可能會想到在Agentic的訊息上而不是在早期模式上我認為這是一個重要的趨勢而坦白說AGI的路線感覺像是一種旅程不像是一個地點但我覺得這類Agentic的工作可以幫助我們在這段很長的旅程進一步前進謝謝

Tool Used 15 hours 5 hours 47 hours 6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In conclusion, our research significantly advances automated ques- tion answering systems for customer service. Integrating retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with a knowledge graph (KG) has improved retrieval and answering metrics, and overall service effec- tiveness. Future work will focus on: developing an automated mech- anism for extracting graph templates, enhancing system adaptabil- ity; investigating dynamic updates to the knowledge graph based on user queries to improve real-time responsiveness; and explor- ing the system’s applicability in other contexts beyond customer service. 7 COMPANY PORTRAIT About LinkedIn : Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.

 Apple Intelligence in five minutes. It's personal intelligence right where you need it, on your Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Writing tools are an example of the incredible power of Apple Intelligence. Say you're writing an email. You can change the tone to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise. Another way writing tools can help you is with proofread. With proofread, you can nail the grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. If you've rambled on in your email, bring out the key points and add them as a TLDR. Apple Intelligence is also great when it comes to images. Let's jump in with Genmoji. You want a T-Rex on a surfboard? You've got a T-Rex on a surfboard. Simply type a description of the emoji you want. How about a smiley face with cucumber eyes or something random like a squirrel DJ? Because Apple Intelligence knows who's in your photo library, you can turn your friend V into an astronaut. Next up, image playground. Create awesome images in seconds, like an image of a cat as a chef. Just type rooftop and any other descriptive words, and it generates the image in the middle playground area. Then choose a style like animation, sketch, or illustration, and it's done. Apple Intelligence also understands who people are in your photo library, so you can create a personalized image of them for their birthday, or your mom is a superhero. Image One can transform your rough sketch into a polished image. You can use Apple Pencil to circle it, and Image One analyzes your sketch in words and creates an image for you like magic. Siri takes a huge step forward and is now supercharged by Apple Intelligence. When you talk to Siri, you'll notice this elegant glowing light around the edge of your screen that shows Apple Intelligence working for you. With natural language, you can speak to Siri more naturally thanks to richer language understanding capabilities. If you stumble over words, Siri still understands what you're getting at. What's the weather tomorrow morning at Muir Beach? I mean Muir Woods. The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning near Muir Woods National Monument. Siri also remembers what you've just been talking about. Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9 AM. Hike is scheduled for 9 AM to 11 AM on June 11th. Next, personal context draws from your photos, calendar events, messages, and other apps. So let's say your mom is coming to visit. Simply ask, Siri, when is mom's flight landing? Siri already knows who mom is and will cross-reference flight details from an email to give you an up-to-date arrival time. If you've forgotten what plans you have, you can say, what's our dinner plan? Siri knows you mean you and your mom and will find that information in a text she sent you. If you don't want to ask Siri out loud, you can now type to Siri. Just a double tap at the bottom of the screen and you can quickly and quietly type your Siri request. Because Apple Intelligence is personal, priority notifications show what's important to you by putting the most important ones at the top of the stack. Personal Intelligence can also make you the star in your very own memory movie. It understands who's in your photo library, so you can just ask photos to create a movie about Leo learning to fish. And it'll whip up a film starring Leo, water, fishing rods, and depending on how successful Leo was, a fish. So those are just a few of the ways Apple Intelligence can help you every day. It's super easy to use and gives you peace of mind knowing it's designed with privacy from the ground up. So that's Apple Intelligence, AI for the rest of us.

[32;1m[1;3mThe task is clear, I need to summarize the provided text about Apple Intelligence. My goal is to extract the most important points and details from the text and present them in a concise and organized manner. Given the length of the text, I don't need to divide it into chunks.

Action: Search a txt's content
Action Input: {"search_query": "Apple Intelligence", "txt": "Apple Intelligence in five minutes. It's personal intelligence right where you need it, on your Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Writing tools are an example of the incredible power of Apple Intelligence. Say you're writing an email. You can change the tone to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise. Another way writing tools can help you is with proofread. With proofread, you can nail the grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. If you've rambled on in your email, bring out the key points and add them as a TLDR. Apple Intelligence is also great when it comes to images. Let's jump in with Genmoji. You want a T-Rex on a surfboard? You've got a T-Rex on a surfboard. Simply type a description of the emoji you want. How about a smiley face with cucumber eyes or something random like a squirrel DJ? Because Apple Intelligence knows who's in your photo library, you can turn your friend V into an astronaut. Next up, image playground. Create awesome images in seconds, like an image of a cat as a chef. Just type rooftop and any other descriptive words, and it generates the image in the middle playground area. Then choose a style like animation, sketch, or illustration, and it's done. Apple Intelligence also understands who people are in your photo library, so you can create a personalized image of them for their birthday, or your mom is a superhero. Image One can transform your rough sketch into a polished image. You can use Apple Pencil to circle it, and Image One analyzes your sketch in words and creates an image for you like magic. Siri takes a huge step forward and is now supercharged by Apple Intelligence. When you talk to Siri, you'll notice this elegant glowing light around the edge of your screen that shows Apple Intelligence working for you. With natural language, you can speak to Siri more naturally thanks to richer language understanding capabilities. If you stumble over words, Siri still understands what you're getting at. What's the weather tomorrow morning at Muir Beach? I mean Muir Woods. The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning near Muir Woods National Monument. Siri also remembers what you've just been talking about. Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9 AM. Hike is scheduled for 9 AM to 11 AM on June 11th. Next, personal context draws from your photos, calendar events, messages, and other apps. So let's say your mom is coming to visit. Simply ask, Siri, when is mom's flight landing? Siri already knows who mom is and will cross-reference flight details from an email to give you an up-to-date arrival time. If you've forgotten what plans you have, you can say, what's our dinner plan? Siri knows you mean you and your mom and will find that information in a text she sent you. If you don't want to ask Siri out loud, you can now type to Siri. Just a double tap at the bottom of the screen and you can quickly and quietly type your Siri request. Because Apple Intelligence is personal, priority notifications show what's important to you by putting the most important ones at the top of the stack. Personal Intelligence can also make you the star in your very own memory movie. It understands who's in your photo library, so you can just ask photos to create a movie about Leo learning to fish. And it'll whip up a film starring Leo, water, fishing rods, and depending on how successful Leo was, a fish. So those are just a few of the ways Apple Intelligence can help you every day. It's super easy to use and gives you peace of mind knowing it's designed with privacy from the ground up. So that's Apple Intelligence, AI for the rest of us."}[0m[95m

真是太棒了我沒想到AI會這麼好我做了一些現場的示範當中有些東西失敗了AI會重新輸入失敗的部分我其實有很多時候會覺得哇 我的AI系統我真的不能相信我的AI系統只是這樣自行調整但我從GPT上用了一個例子來自我學習的請你給女生在讀書時發出一張圖片然後把圖片跟男生一樣例如jpeg請你寫下女生在讀的圖片所以像這樣今天AI人士可以決定首先要決定男生的姿勢然後找出對的模式可能是抱抱的然後要把姿勢取出然後下一個要找出對的模式來把女生的圖片作為指示來做進行然後用來寫圖片然後最後用來寫言語今天我們有些AI人士我不會說他們很實際他們很隨意他們不常用但當他們用的時候其實還蠻有趣的但用AI人士來做有時候可以重新復發從前的失敗我自己已經找到有些人用資料人員在我工作上我只是一份資料人員但我沒有感覺到自己在搜尋花了很長時間我只會把資料人員送到資料人員在幾分鐘內再看看有什麼可以做有時候可以有時候不可以但這已經是我的個人工作最後的設計模式是多人人合作這是一個有趣的東西但它比你可能想像的更好但它比你可能想像的更好但左邊是一張圖片叫做Chatdev是完全開放的是開放的很多人都看到Demo的社交媒體的Demonstration的DemonstrationChatdev是開放的它在我的電腦上開放Chatdev是一個多人人合作的系統你會提供一種LM在某個時候像是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人或是一個軟體工程機的經理人而這堆的經理人你建立的你會提供LM告訴他們你現在是一個軟體工程機的經理人你現在是一個軟體工程機的經理人他們會合作有一個廣泛的交流如果你們告訴他們請發展一個遊戲發展一個GoMoki遊戲他們會在幾分鐘內寫文章測試編輯然後發展像是非常複雜的程式不一定會成功我用過了有時候不成功有時候很厲害但這技術真的在變得更好而一個設計的模式就像是多個經理人的討論有不同的經理人例如有ChaiGPD還有Gemini討論著這其實也會有更好的表現所以有很多類似的經理人一起合作也有很強大的設計模式所以說起來總結來說這些是我們所見的模式如果我們用這些模式我們很多人都能夠得到很快的實力我認為Agentic的設計模式是非常重要的這是我的小圖我預計Agentic的設計模式在今年會大幅地增長因為Agentic的工作有些人很難熟悉的事就是我們在LM上發表訊息我們會馬上回應在一年多前我去Google發表訊息我們叫做大搜尋我們會發出長期訊息我失敗的原因是因為當你發表搜尋你會回應不到一半這是人類的方式我們喜歡那種即時的訊息但在很多Agentic的工作我認為我們需要學習如何提供Agentic的訊息讓人們用心地等待可能甚至等待一小時讓人們回應但我看到很多新手提供一些訊息給別人然後再檢查五分鐘後這並不成功我認為這會很困難我們需要與Agentic的一些人一起做這件事我失敗了另外,另一個重要的步驟是快速的訊息在Agentic的工作我們在每個部分都在編繩所以LM會在讀取訊息的速度上編繩所以能夠在讀取訊息的速度上編繩比任何人都要快這很棒我認為編繩的速度會很快即使LM的質量是低也會有好的成果相比起更慢的LM可能會有一點點困難因為可能會讓你在這段路上很多多次走我認為我所展示的結果是GPD3和Agent的建築在第一張圖表上而Candidly我真的期待Clar 4、GPD5、Gemini 2.0以及其他一般的一般的模式在Mimpio建築而我認為如果你想要在GPD5上發展你可能會比較接近那種程度的表現或是一些應用程式你可能會想到在Agentic的訊息上而不是在早期模式上我認為這是一個重要的趨勢而坦白說AGI的路線感覺像是一種旅程不像是一個地點但我覺得這類Agentic的工作可以幫助我們在這段很長的旅程進一步前進謝謝

Final Answer: Apple Intelligence offers personal intelligence on devices like Mac, iPad, and iPhone. It features writing tools that can help change the tone of an email to sound more friendly, professional, or concise. These tools can also assist with proofreading to ensure proper grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. Apple Intelligence excels in image processing, for instance, enabling users to create personalized images from descriptions, and even recognising people from the user's photo library to create personalized images. Siri, now supercharged by Apple Intelligence, has a better understanding of natural language and can respond to more complex queries. The system remembers user context from photos, calendar events, messages, and other apps. For example, it can cross-reference flight details from an email and provide up-to-date arrival times. Users can also type their queries to Siri. The system prioritizes notifications based on the user's needs and can create personalized memory movies from the user's photo library. Apple Intelligence ensures user privacy and is designed to be easy to use, offering daily assistance.[0m
