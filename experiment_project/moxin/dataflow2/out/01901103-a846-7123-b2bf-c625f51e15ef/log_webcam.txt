RuntimeError: failed to init event stream

Caused by:
    subscribe failed: Some nodes exited before subscribing to dora: {NodeId("object_detection")}

    This is typically happens when an initialization error occurs
                    in the node or operator. To check the output of the failed
                    nodes, run `dora logs 01901103-a846-7123-b2bf-c625f51e15ef object_detection`.
